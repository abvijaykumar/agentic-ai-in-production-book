# SupportMax Pro - Enterprise Use Case

This directory contains the source code for **SupportMax Pro**, the primary enterprise use case developed throughout the book *"Agentic AI in Production"*.

The application evolves through several versions, demonstrating the lifecycle of building a production-ready Agentic AI system.

## Project Structure

The project is evolved in stages, represented by the following directories:

### [v0.5-baseline](./v0.5-baseline)
The **Baseline** version. This serves as the starting point, implementing basic functionalities without advanced agentic behaviors. It establishes the core application architecture.

### [v1-mvp](./v1-mvp)
The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. This version introduces the first set of agentic capabilities. It demonstrates how to integrate agents into the baseline to solve specific problems.

### [v2-cognitive](./v2-cognitive)
The **Cognitive** version. This stage adds advanced reasoning and cognitive capabilities to the agents. It focuses on improving the quality of responses and handling more complex user intents.

### [v3-enterprise](./v3-enterprise)
The **Enterprise** version. The fully realized application. It includes production-grade features such as:
- Scalable architecture
- Robust error handling and observability
- Security and compliance
- Integration with external enterprise systems
